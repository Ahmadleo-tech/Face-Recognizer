## Face Detection with OpenCV

This Python script demonstrates basic face detection using OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier. The script loads an image, detects faces, and highlights them with rectangles.

### Features
- **Face Detection:** Utilizes OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier to detect faces in an image.
- **Image Processing:** Resizes the image for faster processing and converts it to grayscale for detection.
- **Visual Output:** Draws rectangles around detected faces and displays the image with the highlighted faces.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-detection-opencv.git
   ```
2. Install OpenCV:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

### Usage
1. Place the image you want to process in the project directory.
2. Update the file path in the script to point to your image.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python face_detection.py
   ```

### Code Explanation
- **Loading the Cascade File:** Loads the pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier for face detection.
- **Load and Resize Image:** Reads the image file and resizes it for processing.
- **Convert to Grayscale:** Converts the image to grayscale as the face detection algorithm requires it.
- **Detect Faces:** Applies the face detection algorithm and retrieves the coordinates of detected faces.
- **Draw Rectangles:** Draws rectangles around the detected faces.
- **Display Image:** Shows the image with highlighted faces and waits for a key press before closing.

### Example
Replace `'D:/Python/PYTHON PROGECTS/Face Recognizer/A..jpg'` with the path to your own image file. When you run the script, it will display the image with rectangles drawn around detected faces.
